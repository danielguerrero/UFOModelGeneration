# VLLGeneration

Here is described how to generate events including gridpacks for the VLL UFO model (or similar)

## GridPack Generation

Step 1. Clone the whole genproductions from git and work there. This example uses a Madgraph model, so that will be the working directory.
```
mkdir VLLGeneration
cd VLLGeneration
git clone https://github.com/cms-sw/genproductions.git
cd /VLLGeneration/genproductions/bin/MadGraph5_aMCatNLO # working directory
```

Step 2. Clone the templates in this repository in the cards directory
```
mkdir VLLs2LLPs 
```
